            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="./assets/images/mmaze.jpg" alt="Michael Maze photo" class="right-image" width="300" height="300">
            <p>Hello! My name is Michael Maze.</p>
            <p>Over the course of my adult life I went from soldier in the United States Army, to handy-man, to detention officer
                eventually finding myself in college studying, of all things, networking and communications management. This education opened 
                some doors into the telecom world, which in turn led to a position in data analytics, process documentation, and product ownership.
            </p>
            <p>Some hobbies that aren't listed are that I like to read anything and (just about) everything, especially books in the Star Wars universe.
                I am a HUGE Star Wars nerd. Darth Bane was my favorite series, and don't get me started on who I would have had train Anakin instead of Obi-Wan. What a mistake. 
            </p>
            <p>I also enjoy getting outside on my adventure motorcycle and seeing what the open desert has to offer. I am an Arizonan born and raised, and want to try to see as much
                of the beautiful desert landscape as I can. </p>
            <p>From a work standpoint, I always want to dig down deeper. I feel that there is always something left to glean from a given dataset. Understanding that, I like to take a tiered approach
                to every project. First, determine the problem statement. What are we trying to solve for? Second, look at the data available and determine what is relevant, and what is not.
                Third, compile the data in a structured analytical database and start to dig. I isnt uncommon for me to dream about complex problems and solve them that way. 
                Ultimately, I get intrinsic satisfaction from solving complex puzzles that turn into successful recommendations. Money is nice, too.
